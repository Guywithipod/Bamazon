Bamazon is a command line app that presents items for sale to a customer. The information comes from a SQL database. To begin the user must first type node bamazon into the terminal first. They will then be presented with the information ids, product names and price. The customer then selects the id of the product they want and how many units they wish to purchuse. They will then be presented with the total price.
